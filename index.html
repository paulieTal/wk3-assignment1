    <h1>Saipan's Must Try Restaurants</h1>
    <p class="food-box">Food is something you should try and experience everytime you travel, so as shown below, here are a couple of my favorite places to dine,
    and I hope it brings you interest when you would visit Saipan someday.</p>

    <h2>Best places to Dine:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mc. Donalds</li>
      <li>Kentucky Fried Chicken</li>
      <li>Cafe 670</li>
      <li>Pacific Island Club</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mc. Donalds. | Pale Arnold Rd, Chalan Rueda, Saipan</h3>
    <p>Mc. Donalds serves great meals, which I enjoy the most. They even have refreshments and desserts for you. 
      The employees are welcoming, along with their birthday clown, who makes the environment for Mc. Donalds lively.
