  <p>Mc. Donalds serves great meals, which I enjoy the most. They even have refreshments and desserts for you.
    The employees are welcoming, along with their birthday clown, who makes the environment for Mc. Donalds lively.

  <ul>
    <li>Their chicken nuggets</li>
    <li>Mc. Flurry</li>
    <li>Their enviornment</li>
  </ul>
